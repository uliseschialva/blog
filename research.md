<p style="text-align:justify;"> Spatial filtering of information in the hippocampal pyramidal neuron's CA1 region:  Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the cell's geometry and its ability to transmit signals. By analyzing the biophysical resonant mechanisms that can be supported by the spatial structure of the neuron, we aim to gain a better understanding of how this structure influences the processing and transmission of information within the brain. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Dynamic properties of inhibitory networks: this line of research focuses on the dynamical properties of inhibitory neural mass models, with the aim of understanding how different types of inputs can be modeled in these types of systems. Specifically, we utilize minimal models of the Wilson-Conway type to investigate networks with mutually inhibitory connections and try to identify new types of dynamic mechanisms that regulate the activity of neuron populations. Through this research, we hope to gain a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms that govern the processing of information within different regions of the brain, and to develop more accurate and effective models of these processes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Modeling and dynamic reconstruction for optogenetic data: this line of researching involves the use of a variety of techniques from multiple disciplines. Specifically, we utilize recently developed dyamical systems reconstruction algorithms to fit different artificial neural networks models to experimental data obtained through optogenetic methods.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Math-eclectic questions: this researchs cover a range of mathematical topics, including point-set topology, foundations of axiomatic geometry, and dynamical systems. While I do not approach these topics with the aim of systematic study, I do explore them in my own unique way. By my professional bias, I have a particular curiosity for formal objects and their theories :)</p>
